# This script was designed to nuke entire ASN's out of my Firewall policy !

This got written because facebook. They were scrapping a mirror for 5 days straight, generating 500GB a day (and apparently, those specific IPs were know for abuse and they don't care)

This script is written in a trashy way (basically put together in 10 minutes. might be usefull for some people though).

The base file has to be downloaded from bgp.tools here : https://bgp.tools/table.txt

Change the name of the ASN var and the address-set var to suite your needs.
